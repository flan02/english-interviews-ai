# Full-Stack Developer Interview Practice – Dan Chanivet

Here are 10 common interview questions with my polished answers to help me practice and improve my communication skills.

---

### 1. Tell me a bit about yourself.

Hi, my name is **Dan Chanivet**. I was born and raised in **Buenos Aires, Argentina**, and I'm 36 years old. I've been working as a software developer since 2017, taking on various roles across web development. I've worked on both the frontend and backend using technologies like **Next.js, React.js, Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, MongoDB**, and more.

---

### 2. What’s your favorite project, and why?

My favorite project is **2kCeltics**. I've been working on it for five years and handled both frontend and backend development. I also configured the ORM and database to manage user data, and built internal and third-party APIs to integrate with platforms like **Twitch** and **YouTube**.  
It's designed for **Boston Celtics fans**, who can watch a simulated league, track player stats, and follow games in a fun, unique way.

### 3. How do you usually start working on a new task or feature?

Before I start coding, I always analyze the **recommended workflow** provided by the project leader. I might add some of my preferences later, but I try to stay aligned with the overall structure.  
If I’m managing the task independently, I search for similar projects, study their code or documentation, and then start coding from scratch.

---

### 4. How do you approach debugging?

Debugging is a complex but essential part of development. First, I make sure the project is backed up to avoid losing valuable data. Then, I usually **create a new branch** (I work with GitHub), and try to solve the issue on my own. If I get stuck, I’m not afraid to **ask for help**.  
That’s how I’ve learned to live with bugs in my career — step by step and team-first.

---

### 5. Do you have experience working in remote or distributed teams?

Yes, I do. I have strong experience working **remotely** and with **distributed teams**. We typically follow **SOLID principles**, meet once a week to share updates, and support each other. We also use those meetings to discuss ideas and plan strategies for upcoming tasks or projects.

---

### 6. How do you stay updated with new tech and trends?

I use a mix of strategies to stay current. I regularly read **documentation** for the tools I use, actively participate in **tech communities and forums**, and follow **YouTube channels** that post updates or tutorials whenever a technology is released or modified.  
This constant learning helps me improve my skills and stay ahead.

---

### 7. Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly.

Once, I was asked to learn a new frontend library that added **2D animations** to our website — and I had only one weekend to do it. I studied for almost **10 hours a day**, watching tutorials and reading the documentation.  
In the end, I felt proud that I could learn the library and successfully integrate it into the existing project.

---

### 8. What are your salary expectations?

Given the current IT market and my extensive experience as a full-stack developer, I'm seeking a salary around **$30 per hour** or at least **$5,000 monthly**.  
However, if the company's budget can't support that amount at the moment, I'm open to **discussing a compensation** that works for both sides.

---

### 9. What are your goals for the next 5 years?

I'm very interested in working for an **international company** because I want to grow as a developer.  
In five years, I see myself working remotely for a foreign team, possibly living in another country, and speaking **English fluently**—just like a native speaker.

---

### 10. Is there something else from your background that shaped your career?

Before I started programming, I played **basketball for 10 years** until a knee injury ended that chapter of my life.  
Although it was a difficult time, I learned the value of **discipline and effort**. That mindset has stayed with me. I push myself out of my comfort zone and never settle. I'm always looking for ways to get better at what I do.
