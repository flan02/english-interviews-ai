# MERN Stack Developer Interview Practice

This document contains a set of common technical interview questions and my responses, refined to sound natural and professional — like a native English-speaking developer from the U.S.

## 1. Can you tell me about your previous experience working with the MERN stack?

**My Answer (Original):**  
I have been working as MERN developer since 2018 and I worked for three small-scale IT companies. During that span, I have gained experience on both front and backend side. I have built many interfaces for websites with the react library and I always put the focus on the users experience and interaction. I think that those are the most important things when you are coding a new platform. As a backend developer I have solid foundations on the express framework but I often develop software with the nextjs framework actually. I know how to connect a backend with third party APIs, I can communicate the frontend with the backend avoiding CORS issues and finally I use the ORM prisma to handle data between database through the database functions.

I've been working as a MERN stack developer since 2018, and during that time I've worked at three small IT companies. Through these roles, I've gained solid experience on both the frontend and backend sides of development. On the frontend, I’ve built many user interfaces using React, always focusing on user experience and interaction — which I believe are crucial when developing any new platform. On the backend, I have strong foundations with Express.js, although I’ve recently been using Next.js more often for full-stack projects. I know how to integrate third-party APIs, handle communication between frontend and backend while avoiding CORS issues, and I use Prisma ORM to manage data flow between the application and the database through custom database functions.

## 2. What are some of the most challenging projects you've worked on, and how did you handle them?

**My Answer (Original):**  
During the covid in 2020, I worked remotely for an international start-up and their mission was provide an app that communicate people how wanted to order food and doordashers that should deliver it. My role in that place was keep, maintain and scale a backend with nodejs by coding middlewares that offer security, communicate the backend with 3rd party apis and serve the database data directly into the frontend to be rendered in react components.

**Improved Version:**  
One of the most challenging projects I worked on was during the pandemic in 2020, when I joined an international startup remotely. The company’s goal was to build an app that connected people who wanted to order food with delivery drivers — similar to DoorDash. My role was to maintain and scale the Node.js backend by developing middlewares that handled security, integrated third-party APIs, and delivered database data directly to the frontend for rendering in React components.

## 3. What technical skills do you consider your strongest when working with full-stack development?

**My Answer (Original):**  
I consider myself as a primary frontend developer since I built more than 100 web pages using technologies such as react, tailwind, framer motion, css, shadcnui, mantine. Said that, I believe that my strongest skill as a developer is create components with react and typescript.

**Improved Version:**  
I’d say my main focus is frontend development, since I’ve built over 100 web pages using technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, CSS, Shadcn UI, and Mantine. With that said, I believe my strongest skill as a full-stack developer is building reusable and scalable components using React and TypeScript.

## 4. How do you stay updated with new technologies and trends in web development?

**My Answer (Original):**  
I'm a passionate developer and I always give my best trying to stay up to date by reading the latest technologies documentation, I'm taking programming courses to wide open my skillset and learn by doing not only reading. Finally, I watch tutorials on the newest technologies to stay informed about AI and agents.

**Improved Version:**  
I'm a passionate developer and I make it a point to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies. I regularly read official documentation for new tools and frameworks, take programming courses to expand my skillset, and learn by doing — not just by reading. I also watch tutorials on emerging technologies like AI and intelligent agents to stay informed and ready for what's next.

## 5. Can you describe your academic background and any relevant training or certifications?

**My Answer (Original):**  
I was a student of mechanical engineering program at La Matanza University in Buenos Aires, Argentina. When I completed the third year I decided to leave and start my own path as a programmer. Since then, I took a ton of programming courses to excel my skill set in the current stack that I work on.

**Improved Version:**  
I studied mechanical engineering at Universidad de La Matanza in Buenos Aires, Argentina. After completing my third year, I decided to leave the program and pursue a career in programming. Since then, I’ve taken numerous online courses to build and refine my skills in the MERN stack and full-stack development.

## Summary

These answers reflect my journey as a self-taught full-stack developer with a strong foundation in the MERN stack. I’m confident in my ability to communicate clearly, solve problems efficiently, and grow with any team. This practice has helped me refine my storytelling and improve my fluency in English — especially in technical contexts.
