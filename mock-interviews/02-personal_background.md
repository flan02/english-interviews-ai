# Written Interview with Dan Chanivet

## 1. Can you tell me a bit about yourself — where you're from, your background, and what your childhood was like?

My name is Dan Chanivet, I'm 36 years old, and I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a child, I was a bit messy and didn’t enjoy studying much. I used to play football at school and spent many hours each day playing video games. I lived with my parents — my dad passed away when I was 18, and my mom is now 75.

## 2. What kind of student were you in school? What subjects did you enjoy the most, and why?

I consider myself a smart person, but during school I lacked the motivation to learn. Most of my academic life, I struggled to pass exams because I was a bit lazy. However, if I had to choose a favorite subject, it would be math.

## 3. What do you enjoy doing in your free time outside of work?

In my free time, I love going to the gym and lifting weights — it helps me relax and stay calm. I also enjoy going for walks while listening to music to keep my body healthy. Additionally, watching TV shows is a nice way for me to unwind and enjoy my time.

## 4. If you had the opportunity to live and work anywhere in the world, where would you choose and why?

I would love to relocate to Boston, Massachusetts in the U.S. Even though the weather is really cold there, I'm a big fan of the Boston Celtics. Being able to watch all their games live in the arena sounds amazing to me.

## 5. Do you prefer working independently or as part of a team? Why?

I've experienced both throughout my career, but I’d choose working in a team. You grow faster by communicating with colleagues, asking for help, and brainstorming ideas together. When working alone, you have more freedom, but it can also come with challenges you might not be ready to solve without support.

## 6. What are some of the most important values you try to bring to your professional and personal life?

Professionally, I believe in being a good person, communicating politely, and always being ready to help colleagues. Personally, I aim to grow as a developer, lead by example instead of giving orders, and keep a clear conscience by always doing my best to improve in any area.

## 7. Can you describe a meaningful challenge you’ve faced in life, and what you learned from it?

A meaningful challenge for me was injuring my knee and having to end my basketball career. The real challenge was starting over and finding a new path. That’s when I discovered programming. The lesson I learned is that you’re never limited to just one field — it’s more useful to be versatile and try to grow in as many areas as you can, like soccer, music, weightlifting, or education.

## 8. How do you usually handle stress or pressure, especially when you're facing tight deadlines or unexpected problems?

Deadlines really are a headache. One good way to avoid problems with scheduling is to stay up to date with the tasks the project lead assigns, no matter what they are. Maintaining good communication with your colleagues, asking for help when needed, and breaking tasks into smaller parts are all effective strategies to make it through tight deadlines without burning out.

## 9. How do you stay motivated when you're working on something that doesn’t initially interest you?

That’s a common feeling when you’re a full-stack developer, because you’ll love some projects and dislike others. I try to deal with it by reminding myself that it’s just part of the job. Some days, I’ll have to work on features I’m not excited about, but I’m a professional developer — I need to stay focused, pay extra attention to the details, and complete the task even if I don’t enjoy it.

## 10. What are your long-term goals, both professionally and personally? Where do you see yourself in 5 to 10 years?

I'm going to impersonate a fortune teller and describe how I see myself in the next five years. I see myself relocated to another country, like the U.S., working in an office as a project leader — and I hope the company that hires me is yours! I also hope my salary increases significantly. That’s how I picture my future in the years to come.
