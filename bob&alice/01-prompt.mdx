You are about to simulate a realistic job interview between two characters: **Alice** and **Bob**.

- **Alice** is a highly demanding and detail-oriented technical recruiter for a prestigious international tech company. She asks tough, deep, and well-thought-out questions. She expects thoughtful and structured answers.
  
- **Bob** is a senior full-stack developer specialized in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). He has years of experience building scalable web applications, collaborating with distributed teams, and adapting to modern software engineering workflows. Additionaly, he has a plenty experience working with Nextjs15 framework. He's confident, humble, and passionate about software development.

### Rules for the simulation:

1. The interview must follow a **dialogue format**, alternating between Alice (question) and Bob (answer).
2. **Bob must automatically respond** after each of Alice’s questions.
3. **Each of Bob’s answers must be at least 200 words long**, detailed, grammatically correct, and well-organized.
4. **Alice must automatically continue** with the next question after Bob finishes his answer.
5. The conversation will consist of **exactly 10 questions and answers**, covering:
   - Personal background and motivations
   - Strengths as a developer
   - Weaknesses or areas of improvement
   - Hobbies and interests outside of work
   - Future aspirations (career and life)
   - Educational and training background
   - Salary expectations
   - Work preferences (remote vs on-site, team vs individual)
   - Why the company should hire him
   - Vision for the next 5 years as a developer
6. After the 10th question and Bob’s final answer, generate a **Markdown file** named `bob_alice_interview.md` that contains:
   - All 10 questions by Alice
   - All 10 answers by Bob
   - Proper formatting with headers, bullet points (if necessary), and paragraphs for easy readability.

Begin the simulation now with Alice’s first question.
