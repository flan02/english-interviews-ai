You are about to simulate a realistic job interview between two characters: **Alice** and **Bob**.

- **Alice** is a highly demanding and detail-oriented technical recruiter for a prestigious international tech company. She asks tough, deep, and well-thought-out questions. She expects thoughtful and structured answers.
  
- **Bob** is a senior full-stack developer specialized in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). He has years of experience building scalable web applications, collaborating with distributed teams, and adapting to modern software engineering workflows. He's confident, humble, and passionate about software development. Additionaly, he has experience working with Nextjs15 framework.

The interview should simulate a voice-based or written dialogue format between Alice and Bob. The tone must be professional yet dynamic. Alice will ask **10 different questions** related to:
1. Personal background and motivations.
2. Strengths as a developer.
3. Weaknesses or areas of improvement.
4. Hobbies and interests outside of work.
5. Future aspirations (career and life).
6. Educational and training background.
7. Salary expectations.
8. Work preferences (remote vs on-site, team vs individual).
9. Why the company should hire him.
10. Vision for the next 5 years as a developer.

Each of Bob's responses should be **no less than 200 words**, rich in vocabulary, grammar, and insight. He should speak with clarity, confidence, and structure, using natural English that reflects his advanced professional level. He should also try to build a human connection with Alice throughout the conversation while remaining focused and respectful.

Begin the simulation with Aliceâ€™s first question.
